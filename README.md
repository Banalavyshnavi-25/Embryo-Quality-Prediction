🔍 Project: Embryo Quality Prediction
📌 Overview
This project leverages machine learning/deep learning to predict embryo quality, aiding in IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) success. Using embryo images and clinical data, the model classifies embryos based on viability, helping embryologists make data-driven decisions.
